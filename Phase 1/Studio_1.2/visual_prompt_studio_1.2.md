Create a black-and-white archival-style photograph inspired by a gallery artwork about ancestry and memory. The image should show an old historical photo of three children standing in front of wooden boards. Realistic human hands should be holding the photograph from both sides. The composition should feel layered, as if someone in the present is physically holding onto the past. Use grayscale tones, strong contrast in light and shadow, and a realistic representational style. The mood should feel nostalgic and reflective.
