## Prompt

Create a digital mural-style illustration that serves as a social protest addressing climate change and economic inequality. The artwork should be displayed as a large public billboard in downtown Dallas where commuters and pedestrians will see it daily. Its purpose is to raise awareness about how environmental destruction and corporate greed impact working-class communities. The meaning of the artwork is to show that pollution, poverty, and profit-driven systems are connected and that change requires collective responsibility.

The subject matter should include a young woman shouting into a megaphone, protesters holding signs that read “Protect Our Future” and “No More Greed,” factories releasing dark smoke into the sky, a cracked Earth in the foreground, and dollar bills falling like rain. The style should be representational so viewers clearly recognize the figures, buildings, and environmental damage. Use strong contrast between dark industrial tones and bright protest signs to emphasize urgency and tension.
